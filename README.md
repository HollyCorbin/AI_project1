For the uninformed search I am using Uniform Cost Search and for the informed search I am using A*. 
The heuristic used for A* is an estimated Euclidean distance to the destination based on the square location of each vertex. 

Run project1.py. It will ask for the name of an input file and then run both UCS and A*. 
It will output the solution and number of nodes visited for each algorithm.

Project assumes squares are 100x100 units and one input file is structed like p1_graph.txt.
